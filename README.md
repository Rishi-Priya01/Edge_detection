# Edge_detection
Edge detection on a Raspberry Pi using OpenCV involves capturing images with a 5MP camera and processing them to highlight object boundaries. This project leverages the Raspberry Pi's computing power and OpenCV's tools for real-time edge detection, aiding in object recognition and navigation tasks.
